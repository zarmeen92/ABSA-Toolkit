;customer services	 negative	Toshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another, and I am not kidding you, I called different hours of the day and you'll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again, since they make it sound like they don't have your history list of your calls right in front of them.	 service
;null	 negative	It's a long and tirring process that after a while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them.	 service
;null	 negative	And at one point, they blame me for installing a bad memory stick when I upgrade my memory for the first time during my purchase of the laptop (I bought the memory stick they recomended).	 service
;null;null	 negative negative	Long story short, since I experience so many problems with my laptop every since I bought it from day one, I didn't ask for a new laptop or a refund of what I pay for a crapy laptop, but just an extension of my laptop warranty for another year, they made a big deal of out that and after so many calls and complaints about their products and services, they finally gave in.	 laptop service

;null	 negative	"I waited another month for approval and for them to ""BUILD"" me a new laptop."	 service
;null	 negative	Here we are another year later and the computer is doing the same thing.	 service

;null	 negative	For my burn thigh which has put a permanent mark on my skin (it happened 7 months ago) they offered me an ITouch 8Gig (you know it is a bit insulating when a company this rich, offer a loyal customer like me, a bottom of their product line as a gift for events like this).	 laptop
;null	 negative	Steve Jobs, probably needs help and donations, and cannot afford a reasonable offers for people that truly are trying to support his baby.	 laptop
;null	 negative	The lesson learned here is: It does not pay to by this loyal to any brand, since all of them are there to simply  to make as much money as possible, as fast as they can, and in this day and age, the customer no longer is right all the times.	 laptop
;null	 neutral	I am not going to sit here and complain about it not having a cd drive and what not because it is a netbook, it is made to be compact and if you want all the other stuff get a laptop.	 laptop
